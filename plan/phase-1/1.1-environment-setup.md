# 1.1 Environment Setup

**Objective:** Set up the development environment for building FocusDragon.

## Tasks

1. **Install Xcode (latest stable)**
   - Download from Apple Developer site or Mac App Store
   - Ensure it's compatible with your macOS version

2. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

3. **Create a Git repository**
   - Initialize git in the project directory
   - Create `.gitignore` for Xcode projects

## Deliverables

- Development environment ready
- Repo initialized with initial structure
- `.gitignore` configured for Swift/Xcode

## Potential Blockers

- **Xcode version mismatch:** Ensure your macOS version supports the Xcode version you're installing
- **Disk space:** Xcode requires ~15GB+ of disk space
- **macOS version:** Some Xcode versions require specific macOS versions

## Success Criteria

✅ Xcode opens successfully
✅ Command line tools installed (`xcode-select -p` shows a path)
✅ Git repository initialized
✅ Can create a new Xcode project

## Estimated Time

30-60 minutes (depending on download speeds)
